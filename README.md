# Fyle Web Development Internship Project

## Introduction

This project is part of the Fyle Web Development Internship. It consists of a frontend and a backend, both of which are deployed on Vercel.

## Backend GitHub URL: https://github.com/suman2mandal/Fyle-Web-Development-internship-Backend

The backend is built using Node.js and is responsible for fetching data from GitHub using the REST API. The tokens for the API are working fine, ensuring secure and authorized data transactions.

To run the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the project dependencies with `npm i`.
2. Start the server with `npm run start`.

The backend is deployed at: https://fyle-web-development-internship-backend.vercel.app/

## Frontend

The frontend is designed to match the color and style as mentioned in the project guidelines. It is built using vanilla JavaScript, which allows for a lightweight and efficient application. 

To run the frontend locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the project dependencies with `npm i`.
2. Start the server with `npm run start`.

The frontend is deployed at: https://fyle-web-development-internship-frontend.vercel.app/
